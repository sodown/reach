# Notes from texts

- I want to make a web quiz that syncs up with Psychology Today profiles and matches people with therapists better
- I know so many people who need therapists so badly but can't find the right ones or are too afraid to meet ones they won't like
- Honestly even tinder for therapists would help
- Lol does psychologytoday have an api
- If they feel they need it for good pr they'll get on board
- Ahaha i'm imagining okc-like questions where the answers are all "yes" "no" "kinda"
- "are you depressed" "kinda" "do you take out anger on people close to you" "kinda" "do you have daddy issues" "kinda"
- "we matched you with 4 therapists in your area who work with clients who 'kinda' sexually assault people"
